Admin Check is an NPM package to check if the current script is running with admin privileges. 

Currently only available for Windows. It uses a native Windows command("net session") that is only available with admin privileges to check if the admin privileges are present.

## Installation

Use the package manager NPM to install Admin Check.

```bash
npm i admin-check
```

## Usage

Returns a `<Boolean>` which is true when admin privileges are present.
```nodejs
const admin = require("admin-check");

admin.check().then(result => {
  if (result) {
    // Do something when admin privileges are present
  } else {
    // Do something when admin privileges are NOT present
  }
});
```
